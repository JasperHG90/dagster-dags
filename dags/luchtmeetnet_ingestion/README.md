## ‚òÑÔ∏è Setting up for local development

Boot up the devcontainer. This takes a while because we are compiling DuckDB from source (required since the extensions are not compiled for ARM-based architecture).

Then:

- If you are on an ARM-based architecture and want to develop your DAG locally, install the DAG/package using:

```shell
just install 1
```

- Else, install using:

```shell
just install
```

On ARM-based infrastructures, we use the optional dependency group 'devcontainer' that will install duckdb from the wheel stored in '/home/vscode/.dist'. For more information about why this is necessary you can check out [this link](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/8035).

## ‚õèÔ∏è Running dagster locally

To run Dagster locally, execute

```shell
just dev
```

This will:

1. Create a '.dagster' folder
2. Copy the 'dagster.yaml' configuration to the '.dagster' folder
3. Set the DAGSTER_HOME environment variable to the '.dagster' folder
4. Host the dagster web UI on http://localhost:3000

### ‚ÅâÔ∏è FAQ
